Experiment the impact of representative sampling of model accuracy and training time

1. Instance segmentation (maskrcnnresnet50)
Sampling method - cluster_random 50% of dataset
- use the train and val dataset for representative sampling
- Keep test set separate for evaluation and comparison fwih model train on full dataset

other methods to experiment
- centroid  
- entropy -- not running 
- Near duplicate removal

-debug query_clust method and use it for experiment


2. Use representative sampling from fiftyine brain
   - use the sampling ratio to sample images with highest rep score
   - have an option to include low score images to capture out of distribution images whose absense may impact accuracy
   - consider using percentile to group images and using that for sampling
